# Prompts for Understanding and Building a Basic GPT

## Understanding the Concept and Logic Behind GPT
1. What is GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), and how does it work? Explain its architecture and core components.  
2. What is the role of the Transformer architecture in GPT, and how does it enable language generation?  
3. Explain the concept of pre-training and fine-tuning in the context of GPT. Why is this approach effective for NLP tasks?  
4. Discuss the importance of the self-attention mechanism in GPT. How does it allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input text?  
5. How does GPT handle tokenization and embeddings? Explain the significance of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or similar tokenization methods.  
6. What are the key differences between GPT, GPT-2, and GPT-3 in terms of architecture, scale, and capabilities?  
7. How does GPT generate coherent and contextually relevant text outputs? Explain with an example of a single prompt and output.  
8. What are the limitations of GPT in terms of understanding long-term dependencies, bias, or interpretability?  
9. Explain how GPT models optimize their parameters during training. Discuss the role of loss functions like Cross-Entropy Loss.  
10. What are the ethical considerations and challenges of deploying GPT models in real-world applications like chatbots and content generation?  

## Building a Basic GPT Version
1. What are the prerequisites (libraries, tools, and concepts) needed to build a basic GPT-like model from scratch?  
2. Explain the step-by-step process of implementing a Transformer architecture, starting with multi-head self-attention.  
3. How do you prepare a dataset for training a basic GPT-like model? Discuss tokenization, padding, and handling sequence lengths.  
4. Write Python code to implement the embedding layer and positional encoding for a Transformer-based language model.  
5. How do you design the decoder block of a Transformer for text generation? Provide a code snippet.  
6. Explain the training process for a GPT-like model. How do you set up the loss function, optimizer, and training loop?  
7. Write a simple script to train a basic GPT model on a toy dataset (e.g., generating text from Shakespearean quotes).  
8. How can you evaluate the performance of a GPT-like model? Discuss metrics like perplexity and BLEU scores.  
9. Explain how beam search or other decoding strategies can be implemented for better text generation outputs.  
10. What are the computational challenges of building and training a GPT-like model, and how can they be mitigated with techniques like gradient checkpointing or smaller-scale experiments?
